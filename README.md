Re-analysis of data from Dong et al.: [Evidence for a limit to human lifespan] (http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature19793.html)

In their paper, Dong et al. claim to provide statistical evidence for an absolute limit to human lifespan. Here I re-analyze the data from one of their central figures and show that it is not suitable to decise between a model where maximum age at death keeps linearly increasing and one where it saturates or declines. 

For a detailed analysis, see my [R report}().
